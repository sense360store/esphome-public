  # LD2412 24GHz mmWave Radar Component
  # NOTE: LD2412 was added to native ESPHome in 2025.8.0
  # Using local copy modified for ESPHome 2025.3.0 compatibility
  # (removed 'filters' argument from sensor schemas - not supported in 2025.3.0)
  #
  # Path resolution: When users include this package from GitHub, ESPHome
  # resolves the local path relative to the downloaded package location.
  # The path "../../components" works for both:
  #   - Local development: packages/base/../../components -> components/
  #   - Remote usage: <cache>/packages/base/../../components -> <cache>/components/
  - source:
      type: local
      path: ../../components
    components: [ld2412, ld24xx]
