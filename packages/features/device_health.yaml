# DEVICE HEALTH PACKAGE
# ============================================================================
# Provides basic device health monitoring.
#
# NOTE: This package is intentionally minimal. Most health monitoring entities
# (uptime, WiFi signal, WiFi info, restart button, safe mode button, ESPHome
# version, and internal temperature) are now defined in hardware configs to
# avoid duplicate definitions when multiple profiles include this package.
#
# This file exists for backwards compatibility and can be safely included
# by multiple profile packages without causing conflicts.
# ============================================================================

# No entities defined here - all health sensors are in hardware configs
