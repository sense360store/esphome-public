## ROOM-BUNDLE-FAN-VARIANTS-001 — Planning-only fan-control variants (Bathroom & Kitchen)

**Status:** planning-only (no firmware release, no WebFlash promotion)

### Summary

This change adds a planning-only proposal for optional fan-control variants of the
Bathroom and Kitchen PoE room bundles. The base room bundles remain the primary
product line. The fan variants are Bathroom/Kitchen-only add-ons and are captured
in a separate config file (Option A) so the stable room-bundle matrix stays clean.

### What changed

* New `config/room-bundle-fan-variants.json` describing five planning variants:
  * `S360-KIT-BATH-P-REL` (relay)
  * `S360-KIT-BATH-P-DAC` (0-10V DAC)
  * `S360-KIT-BATH-P-PWM` (PWM)
  * `S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P-DAC` (0-10V DAC)
  * `S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P-REL` (relay)
* New docs section in `docs/sense360-room-bundles.md` with the variant table and prose.
* New contract test `tests/test_room_bundle_fan_variants.py`.
* This `UPCOMING_PR.md` update.

### Guardrails (explicitly NOT changed)

* No edits to `webflash-builds.json`, `sources.json`, or `manifest.json`.
* No `artifact_name` fields anywhere.
* No `webflash_build_matrix` flip.
* No LED/fan-driver stable promotion.
* No TRIAC variant.
* No Corridor/Living/Bedroom fan variant.
* No existing bundle SKU or lifecycle changed.

### Validation

* `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"` (1163 tests, 3 skipped).
* `validate_configs.py`.
* Per-test scripts for the new contract test.

### Variants

| Variant SKU | Base bundle | Room | Fan control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S360-KIT-BATH-P-REL | S360-KIT-BATH-P | Bathroom | relay |
| S360-KIT-BATH-P-DAC | S360-KIT-BATH-P | Bathroom | dac_0_10v |
| S360-KIT-BATH-P-PWM | S360-KIT-BATH-P | Bathroom | pwm |
| S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P-DAC | S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P | Kitchen | dac_0_10v |
| S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P-REL | S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P | Kitchen | relay |

### Notes

* relay vs DAC(0-10V) vs PWM are not runtime-interchangeable; each is a separate SKU.
* Bundle SKUs are kept separate from firmware config strings.
* Kitchen fan control is framed as extract/MVHR/EC boost, not a cooker-hood replacement.
* No variant is exposed to WebFlash.

### Next steps

* A future implementation PR would define firmware configs, build artifacts, and
  validation before any WebFlash promotion.

## Historical: ROOM-BUNDLE-MATRIX baseline

The room-bundle matrix (Corridor, Living, Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen) across PoE and
USB power options remains the stable, released baseline. This planning entry does not
modify that matrix; it only proposes additive Bathroom/Kitchen fan variants for a
future PR.

* Corridor: S360-KIT-CORR-P / S360-KIT-CORR-U
* Living: S360-KIT-LIV-P / S360-KIT-LIV-U
* Bedroom: S360-KIT-BED-P / S360-KIT-BED-U
* Bathroom: S360-KIT-BATH-P / S360-KIT-BATH-U
* Kitchen: S360-KIT-KITCHEN-P / S360-KIT-KITCHEN-U

* Base bundles remain the main product line; fan variants are add-ons.
* No bundle SKU or lifecycle is changed by this planning entry.
